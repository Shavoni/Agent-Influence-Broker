## 🎯 Immediate Actions You Can Take

### 1. Professional API Testing
```bash
# Instead of this manual approach:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agents -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{...}'

# Use Thunder Client GUI or REST Client:
# - Open Thunder Client panel
# - Import thunder-tests/thunderclient.json
# - Or use api-tests.http file
```

### 2. Live Dashboard Development
```bash
# Instead of manual refresh:
# 1. Edit dashboard.html
# 2. Save file  
# 3. Manually refresh browser

# Use Live Server:
# Right-click dashboard.html → "Open with Live Server"
# Changes auto-reload at localhost:3000
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Detection
```python
# Error Lens shows errors inline like this:
def broken_function():
    return undefined_variable  # ← Error Lens shows: NameError: name 'undefined_variable' is not defined
```

### 4. Professional Git Workflow
- Use GitLens to see commit history inline
- Visual git graph for branch management
- Enhanced blame and authorship info
